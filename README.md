# Credit Risk Scoring Model

This repository contains the implementation of a Credit Risk Scoring Model developed for Bati Bank in collaboration with an eCommerce platform. The objective of this project is to create a model that evaluates potential borrowers' creditworthiness based on historical data and delivers real-time predictions.

## Background

Credit scoring is the process of assessing a potential borrower's ability to repay a loan. This project aims to implement a model that categorizes users as high risk or low risk based on their attributes using machine learning techniques. The model will comply with the Basel II Capital Accord for credit risk management.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask / FastAPI (choose based on your implementation)
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of credit data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
- Machine learning model training (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- REST API for serving the credit scoring model
- Real-time predictions using new user data

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Elelanfik/CreditRiskModel.git
   cd CreditRiskModel

1. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To start the API server, run the following command:

python src/api.py

You can then make POST requests to the predefined API endpoints to get predictions based on user input data.

API Endpoints

- POST /predict: Accepts input data and returns a credit score prediction.

- Request Body:
{
  "feature_1": value,
  "feature_2": value,
  ...
}

- GET /status: Checks the status of the API server.
